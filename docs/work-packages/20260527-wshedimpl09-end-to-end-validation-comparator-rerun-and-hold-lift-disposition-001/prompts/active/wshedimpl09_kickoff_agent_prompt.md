# WSHEDIMPL09 Kickoff Agent Prompt

Scope: local repository watershed validation/comparator disposition task;
flat-file reads/edits only; no external connectivity.
Execution mode: package-end-to-end (default).
Phase plan: execute all phases in package.md sequentially through disposition.

Task: execute WSHED09 objective end-to-end for declared scope.
Constraints: confidence-tier classification required; preserve fail-closed
typed guard posture; no silent down-classification of unresolved blockers.
Autonomy: execute package phases end-to-end and update required artifacts
without requesting additional user direction unless hard-blocked.
Outputs: update package artifacts/disposition for all completed phases.

False-positive block fallback (required):
- If a policy false-positive blocks the full kickoff prompt, retry with a
  shorter prompt containing only scope sentence, single phase objective, and
  explicit file list.
- If blocked again, split into micro-prompts by file group and continue.
- Record each block event and resumed prompt shape in package artifacts.

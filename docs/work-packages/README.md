# Work Packages

Initiative tracking convention inherited from wepp-palimpsest. Each work package lives in a dated directory under this tree.

## Directory naming
`YYYYMMDD-<short-slug>/`

## Required files
- `package.md` — scope, deliverables, dependencies, exit criteria
- `prompts/` — agent prompts (active and archived)
- `artifacts/` — produced docs, contracts, evidence

## Phase shape (inherited from wepp-palimpsest)
- **Phase 0**: docs-only audit / inventory
- **Phase 1**: architecture decision with operator-signed acceptance
- **Phase 2**: single-mechanism implementation, replay-and-checkpoint between mechanisms
- **Phase 3**: closeout disposition

## Conventions
- Dates are UTC.
- Evidence classification per claim: `[DIRECT]` (read source / contract / output) vs `[INFERENCE]` (reasoned from evidence).
- Evidence mode per assessment: **Static** (read and reasoned) vs **Ran** (commands actually invoked).
- Single-mechanism rule: one landed change per replay checkpoint.

## Queued packages
None currently scheduled. The first work package will be authorized when the user determines the bootstrap shape.

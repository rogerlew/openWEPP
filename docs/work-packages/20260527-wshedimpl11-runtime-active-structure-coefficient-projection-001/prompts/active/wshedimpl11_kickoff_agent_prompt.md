# WSHEDIMPL11 Kickoff Agent Prompt

Scope: local repository science-contract/kernel runtime-seam engineering task;
flat-file reads/edits only; no external connectivity.
Execution mode: package-end-to-end (default).
Phase plan: execute all phases in `package.md` sequentially through
disposition.

Task: execute WSHED11 objective end-to-end for declared scope.
Constraints: contract-first sequencing is mandatory; do not modify kernel/runtime
production code until canonical contracts, contract-derived tests, and
pre-implementation contract gate evidence are complete. Canonical SC authority
is required. Use typed guards and hard-fail behavior for domain violations; no
silent defaults/clamping.
Autonomy: execute package phases end-to-end and update required artifacts
without requesting additional user direction unless hard-blocked.
Outputs: update package artifacts/disposition for all completed phases.

False-positive block fallback (required):
- If a policy false-positive blocks the full kickoff prompt, retry with a
  shorter prompt containing only scope sentence, single phase objective, and
  explicit file list.
- If blocked again, split into micro-prompts by file group and continue.
- Record each block event and resumed prompt shape in package artifacts.

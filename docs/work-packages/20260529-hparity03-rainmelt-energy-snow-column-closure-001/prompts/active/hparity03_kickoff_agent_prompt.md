Scope: local repository science-contract/kernel migration task; flat-file
reads/edits only; no external connectivity.

Execution mode: package-end-to-end (default).

Phase plan: execute all phases in package.md sequentially through disposition.

Task: execute package objective end-to-end for declared scope: close semantic
parity for `RM`, `Ep`, `Es`, and `Snow-Water` on the 39-hillslope cohort.

Constraints: contract-first sequencing; canonical SC authority; typed guards;
no silent defaults; baseline provenance anchored to
`wepp-forest_260430_baseline` commit `dac3c950d8b16cc73774bf5ce2e7e11f80baac70`;
no heuristic/proxy physics substitutions in production code.

Autonomy: execute package phases end-to-end and update required artifacts
without requesting additional user direction unless hard-blocked.

Outputs: update package artifacts/disposition for all completed phases.

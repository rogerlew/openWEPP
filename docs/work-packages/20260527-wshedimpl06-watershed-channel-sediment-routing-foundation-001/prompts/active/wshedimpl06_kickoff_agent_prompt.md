# WSHEDIMPL06 Kickoff Agent Prompt

Scope: local repository science-contract/kernel migration task; flat-file
reads/edits only; no external connectivity.
Execution mode: package-end-to-end (default).
Phase plan: execute all phases in package.md sequentially through disposition.

Task: execute WSHED06 objective end-to-end for declared scope.
Constraints: contract-first sequencing; canonical SC authority; baseline
provenance (`/workdir/wepp-forest_260430_baseline@dac3c950d8b16cc73774bf5ce2e7e11f80baac70`);
typed guards; no silent defaults/clamping; no heuristic/proxy process-physics
substitutions in production migration paths.
Autonomy: execute package phases end-to-end and update required artifacts
without requesting additional user direction unless hard-blocked.
Outputs: update package artifacts/disposition for all completed phases.

Mandatory sequencing and governance gates:
- Do not claim full `chnero/chnrt/detach` baseline parity closure unless that
  routine-family behavior is explicitly implemented and validated.
- Promote WSHED03 WS11 sediment publication vector from ignored to active only
  after runtime publication is production-true.
- Preserve fail-closed typed guard behavior for non-finite/domain-invalid
  sediment publication inputs.
- Complete dual review (`review_agent_a.md`, `review_agent_b.md`) and dual
  verification (`verification_agent_a.md`, `verification_agent_b.md`) before
  final disposition.

False-positive block fallback (required):
- If a policy false-positive blocks the full kickoff prompt, retry with a
  shorter prompt containing only scope sentence, single phase objective, and
  explicit file list.
- If blocked again, split into micro-prompts by file group and continue.
- Record each block event and resumed prompt shape in package artifacts.

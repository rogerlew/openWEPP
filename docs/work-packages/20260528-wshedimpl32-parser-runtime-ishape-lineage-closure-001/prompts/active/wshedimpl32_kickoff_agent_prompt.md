# WSHEDIMPL32 Kickoff Agent Prompt

Scope: local repository science-contract/kernel migration task; flat-file
reads/edits only; no external connectivity.
Execution mode: package-end-to-end (default).
Phase plan: execute all phases in `package.md` sequentially through
disposition.

Task: execute WSHEDIMPL32 objective end-to-end for declared scope, specifically
reconciling parser/runtime shape-code lineage so naturally eroded class mapping
from watershed channel input authority is explicit and unambiguous across
parser projection and WS10 kernel consumption (`ishape=3` continuity).
Constraints: contract-first sequencing; canonical SC authority; baseline
provenance; typed guards; no silent defaults/clamping.
Autonomy: execute package phases end-to-end and update required artifacts
without requesting additional user direction unless hard-blocked.
Outputs: update package artifacts/disposition for all completed phases.

False-positive block fallback (required):
- If a policy false-positive blocks the full kickoff prompt, retry with a
  shorter prompt containing only scope sentence, single phase objective, and
  explicit file list.
- If blocked again, split into micro-prompts by file group and continue.
- Record each block event and resumed prompt shape in package artifacts.

# SC-SNOWFREEZE-001 Snow and Freeze Process Contract

Status: `in_review`
Maturity: `draft`
Evidence mode: `static`

## Purpose

Define top-down scientific authority for snow accumulation/melt and freeze-thaw
process behavior, including downstream coupling boundaries in openWEPP.

## Scientific Scope

In scope:
- Snowpack accumulation, density, and melt boundary behavior. `[DIRECT][Static]`
- Frozen-soil and thaw transition boundary behavior relevant to hydrology. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- Required producer/consumer boundary semantics for winter-process handoff. `[INFERENCE][Static]`
- Hourly winter-process forcing transformations derived from daily climate input. `[DIRECT][Static]`

Out of scope:
- Kernel implementation details. `[INFERENCE][Static]`
- Non-snow/freeze domains except required coupling boundaries. `[INFERENCE][Static]`
- Standalone activation of snow drifting process equations not active in the
  August 1995 WEPP release lineage. `[DIRECT][Static]`

## Invariants

| Invariant ID | Statement | Severity | Authority | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-001 | Melt bound and non-negativity branch semantics: post-branch exported melt satisfies `0 <= hrmelt <= Dsavail`, where `Dsavail` is the pre-hour available snow-depth state used by Eq. [3.6.1] branch logic. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-MELT, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-MELT-ASSUMP, REF-SNOWFREEZE-PHYS-BOUNDS | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-002 | Snow-density melt gate: liquid melt export to infiltration/runoff is not allowed until post-update snow density reaches `ρsnew >= 350 kg m^-3`; below this threshold melt remains in-pack and increases density. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-MELT, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-SNOWDENS | `[DIRECT][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-003 | Snow depth-density domain bounds: `Dsold >= 0`, `Dsnew >= 0`, `ρsold >= 0`, `ρsnew >= 0`, and `ρsnew <= 522 kg m^-3`; when `Dsnew = 0`, `ρsnew = 0`. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-SNOWDENS, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-SNOWDENS-LIM, REF-SNOWFREEZE-PHYS-BOUNDS | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-004 | Active snow-update branch consistency: fresh snowfall contribution uses `100 kg m^-3` density and active depth/density updates follow Eq. [3.7.1]-[3.7.5] for settling, snowfall, melt, and melt+snowfall cases; drift-term equations remain governance-only while drift is inactive. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-SNOWDENS, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-DRIFT-INACTIVE | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-005 | Rain/snow partition consistency: precipitation phase partition follows daily temperature logic (`Tmax < 0` => all snow; `Tmin > 0` => all rain; mixed day uses hourly occurrence/diurnal temperature function). | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-INTRO, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-HRPRECIP, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH5-COUPLING | `[DIRECT][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-006 | Frost heat-flow formulation consistency: frost/thaw bookkeeping uses explicit layered heat-flow relations (`Qsrf`, `Quf`) and harmonic-mean layered thermal conductivity per Eq. [3.8.1]-[3.8.4]. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-FROST | `[DIRECT][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-007 | Winter coupling payload completeness: hourly winter outputs required for downstream consumers are emitted with valid units/domains, including `hrmelt`, `Dfrost`, `Dthaw`, `Nft`, `Ws_frz`, and `InfCap_frz`, and daily snow-water term `S` is consistently reflected in water balance semantics. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-INTRO, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-MELT, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-FROST, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH4-COUPLING, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH5-COUPLING | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-008 | Snow drifting governance invariant: process claims requiring active drift transport equations are non-promotable until authority confirms an active drift implementation path for the target lineage. | governance-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-DRIFT-INACTIVE | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-009 | Winter-routine activation branch is explicit: winter hourly processing is invoked when at least one trigger condition is true (existing snowpack, existing soil frost layer, or average daily temperature below `0 degC`), with no silent bypass. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-INTRO | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-010 | CLIM05 parsed snow-control coupling invariant: when parsed `snow.options.*` controls are projected to runtime, coupling must enforce finite/valid control domains (`newsnw > 0`, `ssd > 0`, `newsnw <= ssd`), publish signed `S = melt - accumulation`, and maintain non-negative `snow.runtime_swe` without silent fallback/defaulting. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-INTRO, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-MELT, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH5-COUPLING, REF-SNOWFREEZE-PHYS-BOUNDS | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-011 | SIMIMPL18 day-key partition/publication closure: for active snow coupling and precipitation days where `Tmax <= rst`, liquid runoff-coupling input from direct rainfall/melt is zero for that day key (`RM = 0`), snow storage update remains explicit (`snow.runtime_swe(new) = snow.runtime_swe(old) + accumulation - melt`), and downstream published `Snow-Water`/hydout-equivalent snow storage values derive from runtime SWE state rather than static sidecar control `snow.options.ssd`. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-INTRO, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-HRPRECIP, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH5-COUPLING, REF-SNOWFREEZE-PHYS-BOUNDS | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-012 | Frost routine-chain dispatch and handoff closure: active winter-hourly frost triggers dispatch `winter -> frostN`, `frostN` performs water-state handoff with `frwatc(1)` at hourly entry and `frwatc(0)` at day-end/thaw-complete exit, and freeze-active branches execute `frzng -> frznw` lineage without silent bypass. | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-INTRO, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-FROST | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| INV-SNOWFREEZE-013 | Frozen-soil conductivity authority closure: when frost is present, saturated-conductivity coupling follows `frsoil` fine-layer aggregation with `getFreezeCond` land-use-dependent `kfactor` selection and remains explicitly bounded/typed at the runtime seam (`frost.runtime_infcap_frz`). | hard-fail | REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH3-FROST, REF-SNOWFREEZE-CH4-COUPLING, REF-SNOWFREEZE-PHYS-BOUNDS | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |

## Symbol Alias Map

Canonical symbols in this contract follow WEPP Chapter-3 notation and lineage
names by default. SIMIMPL27 ratifies concrete openWEPP boundary/API aliases for
winter snow/freeze migration scope. Existing typed aliases use
`HillslopeProductionStateSymbol` / `HillslopeProductionFluxSymbol` mappings;
hourly-internal aliases that are not yet produced on runtime writeback are
reserved under explicit `snow.hourly.*` / `winter.hourly.*` / `frost.hourly.*`
namespaces for staged SIMIMPL28/SIMIMPL29/SIMIMPL32 implementation.

## Invalid States

## Producer Obligations

- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-001: Emit hourly winter state/update surfaces (`Ds*`, `ρs*`, `hrmelt`, `Dfrost`, `Dthaw`, `Nft`, `Ws_frz`, `InfCap_frz`) and daily `S` with declared units. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-002: Enforce all `INV-SNOWFREEZE-*` runtime guards before publishing boundary payloads. `[INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-003: Route meltwater to downstream runoff/infiltration only when density-gate conditions are satisfied. `[DIRECT][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-004: Surface typed errors for violated melt bounds, snow-state domains, and frost-branch inconsistencies; no silent fallback values. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-005: Keep drift-activation assumptions explicit; do not imply active drift transport without authority-backed contract amendment. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-006: When parsed snow controls are projected, publish `S` and `snow.runtime_swe` as explicit coupled boundary/state outputs and hard-fail on active-coupling symbol/domain violations. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-007: Publish day-key `Snow-Water` storage outputs from runtime SWE state mapping (not static sidecar controls) and preserve cold-day partition closure (`Tmax <= rst` implies no direct liquid `RM` contribution). `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-008: Preserve baseline-authoritative frost routine-chain dispatch semantics in active branches (`winter -> frostN -> {frzng/mlt*}` with required `frwatc` ingress/egress handoff) and hard-fail on sequencing violations. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-P-009: Apply frozen-soil conductivity authority via `frsoil` + `getFreezeCond` lineage when frost is present and publish bounded, finite `frost.runtime_infcap_frz` seam outputs. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`

## Consumer Obligations

- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-C-001: Infiltration/runoff consumers treat `hrmelt` as event forcing with the same rigor as rainfall forcing where coupling specifies breakpoint-like handling. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-C-002: Daily water-balance consumer treats melted snow as rainfall contribution in Eq. [5.1.1] accounting semantics. `[DIRECT][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-C-003: Soil/erosion-related consumers receiving frost outputs (`Dfrost`, `Dthaw`, `Nft`, `Ws_frz`, `InfCap_frz`) must fail explicitly on missing or invalid winter payloads. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-C-004: Consumers propagate invariant-violation context as typed errors without silent clamping/defaulting. `[INFERENCE][Static]`
- OBL-SNOWFREEZE-C-005: Runoff and storage reconciliation consumers must apply signed `S` coupling semantics and reject active-coupling payloads missing required `snow.options.*` controls. `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]`

## Boundary Disposition

| Invariant family | Detection point | Disposition | Comparator tier impact | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Melt bounds and density gate (`INV-SNOWFREEZE-001/002`) | melt post-processing and pre-routing checks | Explicit branch applies melt bounds; hard error only if post-branch state remains invalid or if density gate is violated | Tier-A gate | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |

| Partition and activation branches (`INV-SNOWFREEZE-005/009`) | daily/hourly branch selection | Hard error on branch mismatch or silent bypass | Tier-A/B gate | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| Frost heat-flow semantics (`INV-SNOWFREEZE-006`) | frost routine bookkeeping | Hard error on invalid equation domain; investigate hourly-heavy deltas per ADR confidence tiers | Tier-B investigation gate | `[DIRECT][Static]` |

## Tolerance and Numeric Notes

This contract follows `docs/numerics/README.md` (semantic parity, not bitwise
parity). Contract-specific interpretation tolerances:

| Tolerance ID | Definition | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| TOL-SNOWFREEZE-001 | Melt bound residual tolerance for post-branch `0 <= hrmelt <= Dsavail` | `1e-12 m` | Comparator interpretation only; runtime branch/hard-fail behavior remains explicit for material violation. |
| TOL-SNOWFREEZE-002 | Snow depth/density non-negative comparator tolerance | lower bound `>= -1e-12` | Runtime hard-fail still required for values materially below zero. |
| TOL-SNOWFREEZE-003 | Density threshold gate proximity tolerance around `350 kg m^-3` | `1e-9 kg m^-3` | Prevents floating-point noise from flipping density-gate branch semantics. |
| TOL-SNOWFREEZE-004 | Zero-depth/zero-density closure tolerance | If `Dsnew <= 1e-12 m`, require `ρsnew <= 1e-9 kg m^-3` | Prevents false closure from product-only checks that can mask invalid nonzero density. |
| TOL-SNOWFREEZE-005 | Frost heat-flow equation residual tolerance for iterative closure diagnostics | `<= 1e-8` in routine-native flux units | Diagnostic/comparator aid; not a silent runtime correction mechanism. |

## CLIM05 Parsed Snow-Control Runtime Coupling Addendum

### CLIM05 Required Surfaces

| Surface | Symbols |
|---|---|
| Parsed sidecar controls | `snow.options.rst`, `snow.options.newsnw`, `snow.options.ssd`, `snow.options.snow_file_present` |
| Climate drivers | `Tmax`, `Tmin`, hyetograph precipitation depth |
| Coupled runtime state/output | `snow.runtime_swe`, `S` |

### CLIM05 Deterministic Rules

1. Active coupling is explicit when `snow.options.snow_file_present` is present
   on runtime state surface.
2. Partition logic uses `rst` threshold:
   - `Tmax <= rst`: all precipitation accumulates as snow;
   - `Tmin >= rst`: precipitation is rain pathway;
   - mixed-day branch: deterministic partition driven by `Tmin/Tmax/rst`.
3. Signed snow-water term is `S = melt - accumulation`; snow storage update is
   `snow.runtime_swe(new) = snow.runtime_swe(old) + accumulation - melt` with
   non-negative closure.
4. Parsed control domains must remain finite and physically valid:
   `newsnw > 0`, `ssd > 0`, and `newsnw <= ssd`.
5. Active-coupling missing/non-finite/domain-invalid controls or invalid
   `S`/`snow.runtime_swe` closure are hard-fail states.
6. Publication mapping closure is required: downstream day-key `Snow-Water`
   aliases must derive from runtime SWE state and must not publish static
   `snow.options.ssd` control values as dynamic storage state.

### CLIM05 Contract-Test Vectors

1. Active coupling nominal vector produces deterministic `S`, updated
   `snow.runtime_swe`, and valid hydrology-coupled closure.
2. Missing active-coupling required parsed control symbol hard-fails with typed
   missing-input posture.
3. Non-finite or out-of-domain active-coupling control/state hard-fails with
   typed non-finite/domain posture and no fallback.

## CLIM06 Frozen-Soil Runtime Coupling Addendum

### CLIM06 Required Surfaces

| Surface | Symbols |
|---|---|
| Parsed frost sidecar controls | `frost.options.wintRed`, `frost.options.fineTop`, `frost.options.fineBot`, `frost.options.ksnowf`, `frost.options.kresf`, `frost.options.ksoilf`, `frost.options.kfactor1`, `frost.options.kfactor2`, `frost.options.kfactor3`, `frost.options.frost_file_present` |
| Climate freeze/thaw drivers | `Tmax`, `Tmin`, hyetograph precipitation depth |
| Coupled runtime state/output | `frost.runtime_dfrost`, `frost.runtime_dthaw`, `frost.runtime_nft`, `frost.runtime_ws_frz`, `frost.runtime_infcap_frz` |

### CLIM06 Deterministic Rules

1. Active CLIM06 coupling is explicit when
   `frost.options.frost_file_present = 1` and `frost.options.wintRed = 1`.
2. Freeze/thaw branch selection is climate-driven and explicit:
   - `Tmin <= 0 degC`: freeze-active branch updates `Dfrost` and
     infiltration-capacity reduction state;
   - `Tmin > 0 degC`: thaw/inactive branch reduces frozen-depth influence.
3. CLIM06 infiltration-capacity coupling uses a bounded frozen-soil reduction
   envelope:
   - `kfactor_floor = min(kfactor1, kfactor2, kfactor3)`
   - `freeze_fraction = clamp(Dfrost / 0.20, 0, 1)`
   - `InfCap_frz = Ke * (1 - freeze_fraction + freeze_fraction * kfactor_floor)`
4. Active-coupling missing/non-finite/out-of-domain controls or derived frost
   runtime surfaces are hard-fail states; no silent fallback/default branch is
   allowed.

### CLIM06 Contract-Test Vectors

1. Active CLIM06 vector emits deterministic
   `Dfrost`/`Dthaw`/`Nft`/`Ws_frz`/`InfCap_frz` and reduced infiltration
   coupling with valid runoff closure.
2. Missing active-coupling frost control symbol hard-fails with typed
   missing-input posture.
3. Non-finite active-coupling frost control symbol hard-fails with typed
   non-finite posture.
4. Out-of-domain active-coupling frost control/state hard-fails with typed
   domain posture and no fallback.

## SIMIMPL27 Boundary/API Closure and Contract-Test Requirements Addendum

### Boundary/API Closure Scope

SIMIMPL27 closes the authority-side boundary/API ambiguity for hourly snow and
freeze migration scope by ratifying concrete alias names in this contract.

Cross-contract consumer ownership for the ratified winter payload is explicit:

| Boundary payload family | Producer authority | Consumer authority |
|---|---|---|
| `S`, `snow.runtime_swe`, day-key `Snow-Water` publication lineage | `SC-SNOWFREEZE-001`, `SC-WATBAL-001` | `SC-RUNOFFPART-001`, `SC-SYSTEM-001` |
| `frost.runtime_dfrost`, `frost.runtime_dthaw`, `frost.runtime_nft`, `frost.runtime_ws_frz`, `frost.runtime_infcap_frz` | `SC-SNOWFREEZE-001` | `SC-SOIL-001`, `SC-WATBAL-001`, `SC-SYSTEM-001` |
| Hourly reserved aliases under `snow.hourly.*`, `winter.hourly.*`, `frost.hourly.*` | `SC-SNOWFREEZE-001` | SIMIMPL28/SIMIMPL29/SIMIMPL32 runtime implementation and downstream coupling tests |

### Contract-Derived Test Requirements (Downstream)

SIMIMPL28/SIMIMPL29/SIMIMPL32 must implement contract-derived tests covering:

1. Alias projection closure:
   existing typed runtime symbols map exactly to the contract alias names for
   `snow.options.*`, `snow.runtime_swe`, `frost.runtime_*`, `tmax`, `tmin`, and
   flux `S`.
2. SIMIMPL28 reserved hourly forcing payload completeness:
   when hourly winter forcing synthesis is active, required climate-driven
   families (`winter.hourly.rad_mj_m2_####`, `winter.hourly.air_temp_c_####`,
   `winter.hourly.cloud_fraction_####`, `snow.hourly.rain_m_####`,
   `snow.hourly.snowfall_m_####`) must be present with valid units/domains
   before boundary publication.
3. SIMIMPL29 reserved hourly snow-kernel payload completeness:
   migration-complete hourly snow families (`snow.hourly.depth_*`,
   `snow.hourly.density_*`, `snow.hourly.depth_available_m`,
   `snow.hourly.melt_m`) must be present with valid units/domains before
   boundary publication.
4. `Dsavail` timing closure:
   melt upper-bound branch uses pre-hour available snow-depth state
   (`snow.hourly.depth_available_m`) with no off-by-one timing drift.
5. SIMIMPL32 frost-hourly payload and routine-chain completeness:
   required `frost.hourly.*` families plus active routine-chain dispatch/
   handoff semantics (`winter -> frostN`, `frwatc` ingress/egress, `frzng`/
   `frznw` freeze lineage, `frsoil`/`getFreezeCond` conductivity lineage) are
   present and validated with typed failures.
6. Typed failure posture:
   missing/non-finite/out-of-domain winter payload symbols in active hourly
   branches hard-fail with typed error paths and no silent fallback.

### SIMIMPL28 Forcing-Emission Scope Clarification

SIMIMPL28 closure scope is restricted to baseline-authoritative hourly forcing
families generated from climate + slope + active snow controls (`sunmap`,
`radcur`, `hr_tmp`, `stmtim` lineage). Frost heat-flow hourly families remain
SIMIMPL32 closure scope, while hourly snow depth/density/melt state families
remain SIMIMPL29 closure scope. Promotion claims for deferred families must
remain explicit `HOLD` ownership until corresponding evidence exists.

### SIMIMPL29 Snow Kernel Port and Hourly State Closure

SIMIMPL29 ports baseline-authoritative snow update and melt branch structure
(`snowd` + `melt` lineage) into openWEPP hydrology runtime coupling for active
snow control execution. Required closure surface for this wave:

1. Hourly snow kernel state publication:
   - `snow.hourly.depth_before_m_####`
   - `snow.hourly.depth_available_m_####`
   - `snow.hourly.density_before_kg_m3_####`
   - `snow.hourly.depth_after_m_####`
   - `snow.hourly.density_after_kg_m3_####`
   - `snow.hourly.melt_m_####`
2. Runtime carry-state publication for day-to-day continuity:
   - `snow.runtime_swe`
   - `snow.runtime_depth_m`
   - `snow.runtime_density_kg_m3`
   - `snow.runtime_settle_day_count`
3. Active branch inputs are required and typed:
   - `snow.hourly.{rain,snowfall}_####`
   - `winter.hourly.{rad_mj_m2,air_temp_c,cloud_fraction}_####`
   Missing or non-finite active-branch symbols are hard-fail conditions.
4. Snow coupling closure remains `S = melt - accumulation` with accumulation
   derived from hourly snowfall water-equivalent partition and non-negative
   runtime snow-state closure.

SIMIMPL29 does not claim full baseline frost energy-balance migration closure.
`frost.hourly.*` family closure remains explicit follow-on ownership.

## SIMIMPL31 Frost Routine-Chain Authority and Contract-Test Requirements Addendum

### Baseline Routine-Chain Authority Map

SIMIMPL31 closes migration-scope authority ambiguity for the baseline frost
routine chain by ratifying routine-to-alias/invariant ownership in canonical
contract text.

| Baseline routine (source) | Call lineage authority | Canonical responsibility | Contract boundary aliases |
|---|---|---|---|
| `winter` (`winter.for`) | Active hourly trigger dispatches `frostN(hour)` when frost trigger conditions are present; frost path is explicitly skipped only when winter coupling is disabled. | Winter-hourly orchestration entry point for frost processing within daily winter loop. | `winter.hourly.*`, `snow.hourly.*`, downstream `frost.runtime_*` payload handoff |
| `frostN` (`frostn.for`) | Main hourly frost driver; performs ingress `frwatc(1)` handoff at active-hour initialization, branch-specific freeze/thaw process dispatch, and egress `frwatc(0)` handoff at hour-24 or thaw-complete closure. | Freeze/thaw branch routing, heat-flow bookkeeping, and daily handoff closure. | `frost.hourly.*`, `frost.runtime_dfrost`, `frost.runtime_dthaw`, `frost.runtime_nft`, `frost.runtime_ws_frz`, `frost.runtime_infcap_frz` |
| `frzng` (`frzng.for`) | Freeze-active branch extension path called by `frostN`; invokes `frznw` when infiltrated/frozen-zone liquid-water freezing is required. | Energy-limited frost-front extension and latent-heat bookkeeping. | `frost.hourly.qsrf_w_m2`, `frost.hourly.quf_w_m2`, `frost.runtime_dfrost`, `frost.runtime_ws_frz`, `frost.runtime_nft` |
| `frznw` (`frznw.for`) | Layer-local freezing helper called by `frzng`. | Fine-layer freezing time/energy closure and frozen/liquid partition updates. | `frost.runtime_ws_frz`, `frost.runtime_dfrost` (through parent update lineage) |
| `frwatc` (`frwatc.for`) | Bidirectional handoff routine: `wbtofs=1` maps water-balance state to frost fine-layer state; `wbtofs=0` maps frost-updated fine-layer state back to coarse soil/water-balance state. | Water-state exchange seam between frost routines and water-balance/soil consumers. | `frost.runtime_ws_frz`, soil-water lineage surfaces consumed by `SC-SOIL-001` / `SC-WATBAL-001` |
| `frsoil` (`frsoil.for`) + `getFreezeCond` (`getfreezecond.for`) | Soil conductivity adjustment path for frost-active conditions; `getFreezeCond` selects frozen-soil coefficient from land-use/plant class; `frsoil` aggregates fine-layer conductivity to layer exports. | Frozen-soil conductivity and infiltration-capacity coupling authority under frost-active state. | `frost.runtime_infcap_frz`, `frost.options.kfactor{1,2,3}`, `frost.options.wintRed` |
| `winthd` (`winthd.for`) | Winter report/output helper routine. | Output/reporting surface for winter diagnostics; does not replace runtime boundary authority. | governance/reporting only |

### SIMIMPL32 Contract-Derived Test Requirements (Frost Scope)

SIMIMPL32 must implement contract-derived tests that demonstrate:

1. Dispatch trigger closure:
   active winter-frost trigger conditions dispatch frost processing and
   explicit disabled conditions skip processing without ambiguous side effects.
2. Handoff direction closure:
   `frwatc(1)` and `frwatc(0)` direction semantics are preserved at runtime
   seam boundaries with typed failures on missing/invalid handoff state.
3. Freeze lineage closure:
   `frzng`/`frznw` branch execution preserves finite/non-negative
   freeze-depth/water-state updates with explicit failure posture on invalid
   energy-time domains.
4. Conductivity lineage closure:
   `frsoil` + `getFreezeCond` land-use coefficient selection remains explicit
   and drives frost-active infiltration-capacity coupling exports.
5. Cross-contract seam closure:
   frost runtime payloads consumed by `SC-SOIL-001`, `SC-RUNOFFPART-001`,
   `SC-WATBAL-001`, and `SC-SYSTEM-001` remain complete, finite, and typed.

## Known Gaps

| Gap ID | Statement | Impact | Promotability | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAP-SNOWFREEZE-001 | Per-invariant comparator vectors for hourly winter outputs (`hrmelt`, frost depth/thaw depth, freeze-thaw cycles) are not yet curated. | Limits immediate automated regression depth on hourly-heavy winter internals. | promotable-with-risk | `[DIRECT][Static]` |
| GAP-SNOWFREEZE-002 | SIMIMPL31 closes frost routine-chain authority mapping, but `frost.hourly.*` runtime family implementation and contract-derived frost execution tests remain open. | Authority ambiguity is removed, but executable frost hourly/process parity evidence is still pending. | promotable-with-risk | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| GAP-SNOWFREEZE-003 | Snow drifting equations are documented in Chapter 3 but explicitly inactive in the August 1995 lineage; active-path authority for openWEPP is unresolved. | Drift-related claims cannot be promoted as active behavior yet. | non-promotable | `[DIRECT][Static]` |
| GAP-SNOWFREEZE-004 | Cross-contract boundary ownership with `SC-SOIL-001` and `SC-RUNOFFPART-001` is explicit, but executable cross-contract comparator vectors for frost-hourly internals are still incomplete. | Promotable contract authority exists; evidence depth for coupled frost vectors remains limited pending SIMIMPL32 and SIMIMPL35. | promotable-with-risk | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
| GAP-SNOWFREEZE-005 | `Dsavail` alias is fixed (`snow.hourly.depth_available_m`) and SIMIMPL29 emits the hourly family, but comparator-tier depth/density/melt vector breadth remains limited for broad climate regimes. | Residual risk is evidence-depth, not missing alias/state publication. | promotable-with-risk | `[DIRECT][Static] + [INFERENCE][Static]` |
